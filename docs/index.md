LingoGO! is a **desktop app for university students who use English as their first language and are trying to learn a new language, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). With digital flashcards, LingoGO! can make learning faster and more convenient compared to using traditional flashcards.

* If you are interested in using LingoGO!, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing LingoGO!, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
