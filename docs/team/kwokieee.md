### Project: LingoGO!

LingoGO! is a **desktop app** for **university students who use English as their first language** and are trying to **learn a
new language**. Founded on the widely established learning technique of **spaced-repetition**, LingoGO! takes all the
benefits of pen-and-paper flashcards in learning, and brings them to the next level with our **powerful indexing** and **sharing
features** -- *without the hassle* of managing actual physical ones. Coupled with our unique **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and
an elegant **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to accompany it, LingoGO! is sure to delight you, and empower you on your
journey in mastering the new language you *have always wanted*.

LingoGO! was created as part of a team project for the module CS2103T (Software Engineering) at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Enhancements/Features Implemented

Below is a summary of the enhancements I have implemented in the project.

* **Enhanced help window**
  * PR(s): [\#39](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/39), [\#148](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/148)
  * Created dropdowns to display information for each command.
  * This gives users more accessibility to help if they just need a quick reminder on how a specific command is used, instead of requiring them to go to the user guide (although that option is still available for them).
  * This also allows our app to be more user friendly when functioning without an internet connection.
* **Refactoring of UI component**
  * PR(s): [\#69](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/69), [\#73](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/73), [\#106](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/106)
  * Refactored the UI component to let the app display flashcards.
  * Created the app logo.
* **Slideshow feature**
  * PR(s): [\#106](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/106), [\#109](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/109)
  * Implemented the frontend for the slideshow feature to receive updates from Model and Logic so that the correct information is displayed to users.
  * This feature allows users to test their memory of their flashcards. The app displays flashcards to them one at a time, and they can key in an answer for each flashcard. The app then tells them whether they remember correctly or incorrectly. This implements the learning technique of spaced repetition.
* **Fixing up of UI bugs**
  * PR(s): [\#59](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/59), [\#196](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/196), [\#222](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/222), [\#223](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/223)
  * Fixed font issues on macOS for help window.
  * Fixed text display issues.
  * Fixed issue where alert windows would cause the app to crash for some macOS users.
* **Addition of tests for list command**
  * PR(s): [\#195](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/195)
  * Added tests for the list command to increase test coverage.
