# LingoGO!
- LingoGO! is for university students who use English as their first language and are trying to learn a new language. It provides a fast way to generate flashcards so that students can memorise words faster.

- This project is done as part of CS2103T at NUS. This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
